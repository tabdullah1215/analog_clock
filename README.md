EVERWISE - ANALOG CLOCK CODING EXERCISE

Used React and HTML5 Canvas for this exercise.

Clock state not mapped to current time to facilitate quicker time lapses.

Clock state is managed manually in updateTime().

Code block for mapping state to current time is commented out and can replace manual mapping.

updateTime is called by timer and drives clock functionality by setting clock time units and setting state which triggers re-render.
